# About Lendsqr test

The test was about replicating the figma designs that was being given

We were also given 2 API which are
Get all users https://6270020422c706a0ae70b72c.mockapi.io/lendsqr/api/v1/users
Get user details by id https://6270020422c706a0ae70b72c.mockapi.io/lendsqr/api/v1/users/:id

the Get user details API gives an error when I opened it.

# Login page

For the login page, I only submitted the data to the localstorage since we are not given login API. and I checked
the users API that was given, no password key there.

I created a signup page which I submitted the form to localStorage and for the login page, I get items from the local storage.
